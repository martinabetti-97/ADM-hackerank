- **homework1_betti.ipynb** : in this jupyter notebook you will find solutions for both problem 1 and problem 2. Each category has a section and each single exercise is titled. When part of the code was already given I added it in here whenever it was editable in hackerrank. 

- **/stamps** : in the solved.pdf a list of all the solved exercises without repetitions, while the pdf files named with pg*.pdf are the stamps from the submission section in cronological order. I've submitted some exercises more than one time for testing purposes. You may find the best version for each exercises besides "Validating phone numbers" which I think has a bug (more details in the code), while I did not succeed to implement the best code for "Map and Lambda Function" (I couldn't find a way to return the empty list for zero) and "The Minion Game" (timeout for 3/14 tests).
